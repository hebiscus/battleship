# Notes before checking out the live version
This project is by no means polished and lacks several things that will be listed below, but if you want to play a very boring battleship game, then current state of this app is sufficient for that.

# What NEEDS to be improved (if I want to show it off and not get embarassed):

- When it comes to placing ships horizontally highlight on hover doesn't work ideally. You can hover on already placed ships (during placing) and yoink colour from them. Issue doesn't affect ships placed vertically. Haven't investigated sufficiently.

- Computers board has predeterminated ship placing ie. computer doesn't pick ship placement randomly. It's a massive blunder, but there's no word for it in the project requierements and my attempt at making it work failed miserably. HARD to fix.

- Computer can't attack Column "H" except if there's a ship on there. Simple to fix. 

- You can't repeat the game. You have to refresh the page. Simple to fix.

- Sunken ships don't have separate color. Simple, but quite time consuming to fix. 

- Messages on top of the page regarding the placing don't change after the game starts. Simple to fix.
